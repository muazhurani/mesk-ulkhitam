# Mesk Ul-Khitam Software License

## Commons Clause License Condition v1.0

The software known as Mesk Ul-Khitam ("Software") is provided to you ("Licensee") by Muaz Hurani ("Licensor") under the following License, subject to the additional condition outlined below.

### License

The Licensee is granted rights under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (or other open-source license), as defined in its terms, with the following notable condition.

### Additional Condition: Non-Commercial Use

The rights granted under the License do not include, and the License does not grant to the Licensee, the right to Sell the Software. "Sell" in this context refers to offering or providing the Software, in whole or in part, to third parties for a fee or other consideration. This includes but is not limited to fees for hosting, consulting, or support services related to the Software.

Any commercial exploitation of the Software is strictly prohibited under this License. The Licensee must also include this Commons Clause License Condition notice in any license notices or attributions related to the Software.

### Definition and Clarifications

- **Open Source Basis**: The Commons Clause is added to the open-source License but does not classify the Software as "open source" under the Open Source Initiative's definition.
- **Future Versions**: This Clause applies to all future releases of the Software, without affecting the License of previous versions.
- **Scope of Prohibition**: The Clause prohibits the selling of the Software itself. Licensee may develop, distribute, and sell derivative works provided they do not constitute primarily the resale of the Software.
- **Value-Add Requirement**: The Licensee may use the Software as part of a larger offering provided that the offering adds significant value beyond the functionality of the Software.

### FAQ

**What is the Commons Clause?**
The Commons Clause is a license condition that imposes a minimal commercial restriction on top of an existing open-source license, transitioning the project to a source-availability scheme.

**Is this Software Open Source?**
No. While the source code is available, and many elements of the Open Source Definition are met, the prohibition on commercial sales means it does not qualify as "open source" by the OSI definition.

**Can I Develop Using This Software?**
Yes. You can develop on top of Mesk Ul-Khitam, embed it, redistribute it, and create derivative works. However, selling a product that primarily consists of the Software itself is prohibited.

**What About AGPL?**
AGPL does not fully address the concerns that led to the adoption of the Commons Clause for this project. It does not sufficiently protect against certain commercial exploits of open-source development.

**Impact on Open Source?**
Open source remains vital and thriving. The Commons Clause is a response to specific challenges faced in sustaining open-source projects, not a replacement of open source principles.

**Legal Interpretation of "Substantially"**
"Substantially" in legal context means “for the most part,” or “essentially.” Selling a product which adds only insubstantial value to the Software would be restricted under this License.
